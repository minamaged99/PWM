# PWM_Drawer
Works as a mini oscilloscope that shows the frequency and waveform of the generated PWM signal.
Built using ATmega32 and an LCD     

# Manual
-PWM can be either generated by the same kit (PD7 pin) or from an external kit.   
-The MC reads the input at pin PD6.   
-The user can choose to display frequency or period.

# PROS
It is an inbuilt hardware unit for waveform generation and once we set the PWM mode and duty cycle, this unit starts generating PWM and the controller can do other work.
